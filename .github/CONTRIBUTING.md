## Welcome to the keystroke contributing guide!
First, thank you for taking the time to look at and consider contributing to this project. It really humbles me and gratifies my work effort.
Anyways usually these documents are kind of long and similar in style, so much so that it almost becomes pointless to look at in certain repos,
so I'll spare you the details, and really explain in simple points the aha's and gotcha's in this project.

## In no particular order:
* Follow [llvm coding standards](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html)
    * I myself am just getting started with following standards so no biggie if you make a mistake somewhere, 
    we can fix that in the pr review, important thing is your code works reliably.
    
* Be nice to others
    * Not much needed to be explained here, just be a nice guy/gal. Much appreciated.

## Thats about it!
Wow you read the whole thing? I appreciate it, and I hope you liked the brief style, maybe it was refreshing when compared to other contributing 
guidelines. If you still feel like contributing, check out the [good first issues](https://github.com/timmypidashev/keystroke/labels/good%20first%20issue)
(they don't bite), or if you want take a look at the [current issues](https://github.com/timmypidashev/keystroke/issues) and find something you want 
to help with. Best of luck!
